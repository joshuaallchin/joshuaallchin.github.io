In my time working as a Development Engineer on the Neutron program I took the opportunity to get as involved in as many different parts of the vehicle as possible, working on everything from heat shields to cryogenic methane seals.

## Static Aerosurfaces

![Fig 1](../assets/NEUTRON/Aerosurfaces.drawio.svg)


My main responsibility was the **design and development of the static aerosurfaces** of the vehicle. This involved managing interfaces across a wide range of systems. Given that build priorities focused on primary structures (Thrust Module, S1 Tank, Interstage, S2), I often operated independently with minimal resourcing, requiring strong ownership and initiative.

### Design and Development

This role required full ownership of the aerosurface subsystems, spanning design, simulation, and manufacturing; demanding tight collaboration with multidisciplinary teams to manage complex system-level interfaces.

**Key Achievements:**
- Delivered critical vehicle aerodynamic surfaces under aggressive timeline constraints.
- Developed complete flight hardware from concept to production with minimal engineering support.
- Identified and resolved multi-system integration issues independently.

### Roles and Responsibilities

#### Designer
- Led **concept development** of aerosurfaces from blank-sheet to detailed design.
- Performed **systems engineering** functions including:
  - Requirement capture, derivation, and traceability
  - Risk identification and mitigation throughout the lifecycle
  - Coordination of reviews from **CoDR -> CDR**
  - Authored interface control documents (ICDs) and participated in system-level configuration control boards.
- Sole owner of Aerosurface **CAD in Siemens NX**; used **Teamcenter PLM** for version control, BOM management, and design releases.
- Produced **release packages**, including drawings and part files, to support internal and external vendors.
- Presented design reviews to senior engineering leadership and program management.

#### Analyst

- Independently performed **FEA structural simulations** using **NASTRAN** (linear statics, buckling, non-linear glue modeling).
- Designed and analyzed **Thermal Protection Systems (TPS)** using both in-house and proprietary tools.
- Created custom Python-based analysis tools for:
  - Thermal and structural modeling
  - Data parsing and visualization
  - Reusable simulation workflows for future projects
- Implemented **version-controlled scripts** with `git` for repeatable, auditable analysis workflows.
- Reduced structural design iteration time by automating test-case setup, meshing, and post-processing pipelines.
- Interpolated **vehicle-level CFD results** across multiple flight trajectories to generate time-varying thermal and pressure environments, which were used to derive structural load cases.
- Contributed to the program's **compartment venting solver**, owning 5 of the 8 vehicle compartments and supporting their pressure equalization modeling under ascent, descent, and landing scenarios.

#### Manufacturing Engineer
- Designed custom tooling and fixtures for:
  - Composite layups (plugs, plants, molds)
  - Sheet metal forming (formblocks, jigs)
  - Large Assemblies
- Interfaced directly with manufacturing technicians to troubleshoot and adapt hardware designs.
- Defined process specifications for hand layup and metal forming.
- Reduced composite part cycle time by streamlining tooling design and integrating DFM best practices.
- Conducted shop-floor support during builds to resolve tooling or fit-up issues in real-time.
  
#### Test Engineer

- Supported **heat shield component testing**, including thermal cycle and propane torch-based exposure tests simulating flight-relevant thermal loads.
- Executed **hands-on test operations** using torch rigs, high-temperature insulation materials, and custom-built fixtures for representative boundary conditions.
- Installed and calibrated **thermocouples** on heat shield test articles; supported high-density DAQ systems (**NI 9213**, **NI 9205**) with **FlexLogger** for data acquisition.
- Supported **thermal blanket qualification** efforts in sensor installation and testbed integration.
- Automated **thermal and pressure data analysis** using Python.
- Participated in **real-time test monitoring**, test readiness reviews, and emergency hardware modifications during high-priority test events.
