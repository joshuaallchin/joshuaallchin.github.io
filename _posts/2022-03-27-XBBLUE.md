### Manufacture

ARES had never built a team rocket before due to covid, so as the final lockdown ended the team decided to try to build a full scale, high power rocket in 2 weeks before the end of semester. Whilst building the fin can we found that the method used below was quite subpar, leading to improvements in future rockets.

### Flight

The team needed an L2 certified rocketeer to be able to fly Big Blue so the maiden flight had to wait a few months. After a very acton packed day filled with failed certification attempts and last minute layups, my [L2 flight](https://joshuaallchin.github.io/projects/rocketry/2022/03/27/L2cert.html) was successful, allowing our team to light up Big Blue.

After a number of ignition related failures the rocket finally got off the ground and our team finally had a successful launch.
