Myself and 3 other teammates entered the 2021 FEIT Case Competition and were challenged to meet the following brief:

### Stage 1
Our stage 1 submission detailed a unique development that could integrate into the local area and could provide benefit given [proven experiments]  (https://www.jacobs.com/sites/default/files/2020-06/jacobs-yarra-valley-water-towards-a-zero-carbon-future.pdf) having already been developed locally in Australia.

### Stage 2
After getting through to the final competition round we were given a twist to contend with and received in-depth feedback on our first round submission.

On the basis of the advice given, our team decided to pivot our model to a recommended location (Tasmania) and eventually settled on our final presentation idea, combining a hydrogen plant (taking advantage of Tasmania's hydrogen ready infrastructure) with an existing sewerage plant (providing power whilst increasing its efficiency).

Unfortunately on the night of the presentation my internet failed in the middle of our allotted time so my team had to adapt whilst under pressure. Luckily for me they did splendidly and we managed to walk away with the third place prize for the event.
