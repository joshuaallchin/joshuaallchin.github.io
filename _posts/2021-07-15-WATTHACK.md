Myself and 2 other teammates entered a **2 day** competition where our aim was to work as a team to take some E-Waste and create something new.
### Day 1
We decided we wanted to create a **CNC plotter** as we had seen printers were available for us to disassemble.

Code for our design linked [here](https://github.com/joshuaallchin/WATTHACK2021)

### Day 2
Unfortunately the second day of the competition was also the first day of a statewide lockdown and hence was postponed. More to come.
