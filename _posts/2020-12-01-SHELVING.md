## Description
Certification to AS4100 for 4 existing shelving units involved an inspection and a thorough series of analyses to ensure that the non-standard designs would be able to safely support the desired loads.

### Assumptions
Shelving Unit 1 loading check.

### SpaceGass Model
Linear Static Analyses found that the existing Shelving Unit 2 as shown below was already overloaded, requiring further strengthening if continued operation was needed.

The remaining units were acceptable and could be load rated in their current configuration.
