### Overview
I was brought onboard to undertake the feasibility study, which involved me reaching out to members of the space industry, and developing requirements and constraints for our product.

### Initial Concept
These designs lead to a preliminary concept that I prototyped at 10% scale.

### Manufactured Prototypes
Manufacturing was done jointly between Marand and RMIT, with myself the primary contact for design queries.

### Sierra Space
After my travel to america for [Spaceport America Cup](https://joshuaallchin.github.io/projects/2022/07/25/SAC.html) I had the opportunity to work at Kennedy Space Centre with our partner organisation Sierra Space and see my design loaded up into their LIFE module in the flesh.
