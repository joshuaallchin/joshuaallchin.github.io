As the first member of [ARES](https://www.linkedin.com/company/aerospace-rocket-engineering-society) to attempt L1 certification there was a lot to learn prior to the launch. Being the last launch before fire season, the week leading up to the day was intense and filled with last minute fixes and checks. Due to the short turnaround, myself and the other club member launching on the day were unable to source the motor size we had initially planned on using but managed to rustle up some lower power motors last minute. These motors had much smaller diameters than the housings we had put in our rockets, meaning that without an adapter we would be unable to launch. Luckily Mitch from [HPR](https://www.monashhpr.com/) generously offered use of his 3D printer the night before and was able to provide us with a motor adapter on the day. As can be seen from the above video, the launch went successfully, with the other ARES member's launch also resulting in success even with reuse of the 3D printed adapter. Thanks to all the guys from HPR and [tripoli](https://www.victorianrocketry.org.au/) for all their advice and generosity, the experience was one I'll never forget.
