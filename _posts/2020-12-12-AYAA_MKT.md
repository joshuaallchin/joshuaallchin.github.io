## Description
Over 2020 I took on the Marketing Coordinator role with Victoriaâ€™s [AYAA]( https://ayaa.com.au/) team, my primary responsibility being the creation of content for the various events we held.
Throughout my time in the role I took the opportunity to get involved:
-	Working with the team to pivot into a Covid friendly action plan so we could still deliver on our outreach aspirations for the year
-	Assisting in planning and running multiple online events
-	Creating a podcast pilot episode 
-	Assisting the [ASTRA]( https://astra.ayaa.com.au/) team in testing their program model
-	Running interview sessions for prospective team members
