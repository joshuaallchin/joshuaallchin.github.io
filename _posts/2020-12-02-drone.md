As the team lead for our line following drone algorithm, I'm very proud our submission placed in the top 6 nationally, it was a great opportunity to display our skills and learn new ones too. The video linked goes through the methodology used to complete the competition track, as well as reflecting on areas for improvement in future design iterations. For those interested in the nitty-gritty of the guidelines of the [competition](https://www.mathworks.com/videos/mathworks-minidrone-competition-introduction-to-the-competition-1551870041860.html) or would like to have a fiddle with our [design](https://github.com/joshuaallchin/GODrones) please feel free to do so, I'd love to hear from you if you have pointers or suggestions for future improvements.
